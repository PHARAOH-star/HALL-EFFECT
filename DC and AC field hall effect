The measurement of the Hall effect using a DC magnetic field is a reliable technique for the characterization of the electronic transport properties of semiconductor materials.

Hall's effect is specially used for the determination of carrier concentration, carrier type and the Hall coefficient and mobility of the materials. There are only a very few DC field techniques which are currently used in characterizing materials with low mobility including those used in solar cell technology, thermoelectric technology, and organic electronics.

Presently, a Hall effect measurement method that makes use of an AC magnetic field, rather than the conventional DC, is attracting increasing interest. The method has been devised by Toyo in Japan and has been used successfully for over 15 years, offering better solutions for researchers studying the properties of low mobility materials. The technique can measure mobilities as low as 10-3 centimeters squared per volt per second (cm2/(Vs)), whereas DC field techniques are normally limited to measuring mobilities of about 1 cm2/(Vs) in DC magnetic fields produced by conventional laboratory electromagnets.
